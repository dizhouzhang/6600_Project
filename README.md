Insurance fraud poses significant challenges for both insurers and consumers, leading to financial losses and inefficiencies in claims processing. According to a 2023 estimate from The Coalition Against Insurance Fraud, insurance fraud costs businesses and consumers $308.6 billion a year. This is a substantial increase from their $80 billion estimate from 1990, indicating that this issue continues to exacerbate.

As a result of this phenomenon, insurance companies are constantly searching for novel detection techniques. These often include non-analytical methods such as examining social behavior, personal identification irregularities, or insufficient documentation. Meanwhile, analytical fraud detection methods often rely on supervised learning, which requires labeled data that may be expensive and time-consuming to obtain. 

This project explores an identified use case in which one may not have reliable labeled data, and attempts to answer the question of whether deep learning can be used to singularly identify instances of fraud. Using a variety of unsupervised learning methods, we identify deviations in claims data to isolate anomalies and surmise that these might indicate fraud. We then assess our modelsâ€™ performance when applied to previously unseen data to further evaluate real-world usefulness of anomaly detection as a means for detecting fraud.
